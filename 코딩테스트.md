*주의할 점: 결과가 group 별로 나오는지, 아니면 전체에서 값이 하나만 나오는 건지 아는 것이 중요함*

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--|--|
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |


(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
 

Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

The result format is in the following example.


``` sql
SELECT
    ROUND(COUNT(player_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(player_id)) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction
FROM Activity 
WHERE (player_id, event_date) IN (
    SELECT player_id, DATE_ADD(MIN(event_date), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id );
```



## [Leetcode 570]


*주의할 점:*
1. gropu by를 하고 나서 머리에 이미지는 group화된 이미지를 가지고 가야한다
2. 그러므로 group by가 적용된 곳에서 개별적인 값을 비교하거나 추출할 수 없다
3. 따라서 group by는 서브쿼리절에 넣고 그 이상의 값을 더 계싼해야한다면 where 절을 잘 활용해보도록!
4. 특히 id IN (SELECT managerId ~) 이건 manager id랑 employee id랑 연결시킬때 쓴다. --> 다른 열의 값이 또 다른 열에 포함되어있는지 궁금할때


Table: Employee


| Column Name | Type    |
|--|--|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |
| managerId   | int     |


id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.
 

Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.



``` sql
SELECT name
FROM Employee
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT managerId
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY managerID
    HAVING COUNT(managerId)>=5
)
```



## [Leetcode 602]


*주의할 점*
1. UNION ALL (중복 포함 반출 더 빠름) vs. UNION (중복제거) --> 같은 이름의 열이 필요하고 세로로 합친다. 
2. max가 안먹힌다면 order by 후 limit써라
3. From 에 서브쿼리를 두 번 쓸 수 있다!! 결과값이 통으로 나와야하는데 Group by를 써야한다면! 서브쿼리 한번 더 만들기!

| Column Name    | Type    |
|--|--|
| requester_id   | int     |
| accepter_id    | int     |
| accept_date    | date    |



(requester_id, accepter_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.
 

Write a solution to find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.

The test cases are generated so that only one person has the most friends.

The result format is in the following example.


**Example 1:**

Input: 
RequestAccepted table:


| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
|--|--|--|
| 1            | 2           | 2016/06/03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016/06/08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016/06/09  |


Output: 

| id | num |
|--|--|
| 3  | 3   |


Explanation: 
The person with id 3 is a friend of people 1, 2, and 4, so he has three friends in total, which is the most number than any others.


``` sql
SELECT id, num
FROM (
    SELECT id, SUM(cnt) AS num
    FROM (
        SELECT requester_id AS id, COUNT(requester_id) AS cnt
        FROM RequestAccepted
        WHERE (requester_id, accepter_id) != (accepter_id, requester_id)
        GROUP BY requester_id

        UNION ALL

        SELECT accepter_id AS id, COUNT(accepter_id) AS cnt
        FROM RequestAccepted
        WHERE (requester_id, accepter_id) != (accepter_id, requester_id)
        GROUP BY accepter_id
    ) AS Subquery
    GROUP BY id
) AS MaxTable
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1
```
