## [Leetcode]

| Column Name  | Type    |
|--|--|
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |


(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
 

Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

The result format is in the following example.


``` sql
SELECT
    ROUND(COUNT(player_id) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(player_id)) FROM Activity), 2) AS fraction
FROM Activity 
WHERE (player_id, event_date) IN (
    SELECT player_id, DATE_ADD(MIN(event_date), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id );
```

*주의할 점: 결과가 group 별로 나오는지, 아니면 전체에서 값이 하나만 나오는 건지 아는 것이 중요함*
